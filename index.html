            It might sound glib, but it's not lip-service. I've been very lucky to have spent the last 6 months on a blissful sabbatical. I took the time to clear out my own personal backlog. I travelled to new corners of the world including <a class="roll-link" href="http://resonate.io/"><span data-title="Belgrade">Belgrade</span></a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b9punk/sets/72157633103844836/">Bali</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b9punk/sets/72157633396847820/">Costa Rica</a>.  I practiced painting, drawing and <a href="http://pinterest.com">arts <span class="amp">&amp;</span> crafts</a>, caught up with my reading list, spent time with friends and my family in Colorado, and got into gardening, running, and swimming. It has been wonderful vacation, but as lifestyle it's got nothing on making Internet. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The internet is the most interesting thing...maybe ever. And it's getting more interesting as it swallows or disrupts everything from information, politics, biology, to the planet itself. Designing software and network culture has become the truest, and most relevant of the humanities! Right now it badly needs more design thinking to help identify and solve the right problems and broker the relationship between humans and computers. As a futurist and a designer I really can't think of anything else I'd rather do with my time. Even, like, hookers and blow.

            So, friends, please help me find where I belong. Deciding what to work on, and who to spend the majority of your waking hours with is a pretty big deal, so I made this site to paint a more complete picture of who i am and what I'm looking for than my resume and portfolio can. If I could write my own ticket, it'd look something like this:

          <p>
            I am seeking a senior design-related role on a life-changing, internet software project. With any luck, one of the lives it's been changing (or will) is mine. Ideally this role exists on a small, cross-functional, highly-autonomous team of self-managed, chummy, curious, achievers, who move swiftly to gather and measure user feedback and behavior, which they use to plan, build, and ship interesting and useful products and features. Even more ideally, this team lives within a socially, and environmentally responsible company or organization, with a strong long-term vision and sense of values, who's primary users' success and happiness are directly linked to it's subsistence. And still has a sense of humor about the whole thing.

            Please keep scrolling to read a bit more <a href="#about">about me</a>, have a look at <a href="#work">my work</a>, and <a href="#resume">my resume</a> to get a sense of what i can bring to the table. Then, please <a href="#contact">say hello</a>!

                There's an increasing amount of science that says if you're interested in greatness, and happiness (I am) then you're a lot better off growing talents that you're already good at, rather than trying to catch up your weaknesses and arranging your life around getting to do what you're best at everyday.

            In case you're not into that stuff, here's a story instead:
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-block" style="margin-top: 1em">
          <p class="subhead">Luckily, I did everything wrong.</p>
          <p>
            Thirteen years ago, I dropped out of art school in Colorado, to try to make a living working on the internet in New York City. What seemed (even to me) like a slew of dubious decisions at the time, could not have prepared me more perfectly for the way the world has been turning out. Young and hungry, I had motive and opportunity to become skilled and practiced among the best and brightest.
          </p>

          <p>
            In those early years nothing on the internet really worked yet. The browsers were fighting, the specs were bad, connection speeds were slow, platforms differences were numerous and treacherous, and no one really knew what the internet was good at, but it was supposed to change the world. So I became experienced at designing flashy moving-target projects in war-time conditions. In those strange days after the first bust and before the next boom most of the money came from advertisers, so I worked first in a boutique studio, and later as a contractor for big-time ad agencies. Shortly after the critical mass hit <em>(in my estimation somewhere around 2007 at the "early majority" stage of Facebook)</em> I transitioned totally from client work to web ui/product design.
          </p>

          <p>
            Skipping ahead a few years to today, we're in the age of "mobile" and the browsers, platforms, and connection speeds to support have multiplied! It all turned out to be good practice for my latest (and greatest) project: a complete re-design of TheLadders core product. In six months, we built a brand-new application, and since I was involved from very beginning planning stages, and my awesome team was eager to experiment, we tried out a number of new approaches including responsive design, an atomic-style organization of components and patterns, SASS stylesheet pre-processing, and collaborating on design and copy assets in version control. Along the way there were some <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/video/8160491-those-cute-animal-pictures-could-change-your-life/">lulz and cats</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            If Ray Kurzweil is right, and we are going to live forever, (and I keep up my lucky-streak), I hope for future versions of this story to include many more tales of good and interesting projects, built smart and fast, and not without a little daring, that have an obvious or essential part to play in making our future one of the good ones.
