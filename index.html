        <p>If i could be doing anything at all in the world, I'd choose "working on the future with friends."</p>

        <p>
          It might sound like a clich√©, but it's not lip-service. I've been very lucky to have spent the last 5 months on a blissful sabbatical. I've travelled to new corners of the world including Belgrade, Bali and Costa Rica. I've practiced all variety of painting, drawing and arts & crafts, gardening, reading, catching up with old friends, and running, swimming and strolling in this amazing city. I truly love this things, and it has been wonderful. But while these things are fun, good, and maybe even important, beyond the short-term, they've honestly got nothing on "working on the future with friends."

          The internet is crazy interesting, and it's getting more interesting as it swallows or disrupts everything from information, politics, biology, to the planet itself. Making Internet has become the truest, and most relevant of the humanities! Software and network culture is is where all the action is, and right now it badly needs more design thinking to get better at solving problems and brokering friendly and useful relationships between humans and computers. As a thrill-seeking, futurist designer from the internet, i'm happy to trade these self-indulgences in for a front-row seat. That's why i'd rather work on the future with friends than do anything else with my time. Even, like, hookers and blow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deciding what to work on, and who to spend the majority of your waking hours with is a pretty big deal, so i made this site to paint a more complete picture of what i'm about than my resume and portfolio can. So, friends, please help me find where I belong.

          I am seeking a senior design-related role on a life-changing, internet software project. With any luck, one of the lives it's been changing (or will) is mine. Ideally this role exists on a small, cross-functional, highly-autonomous team of self-managed, chummy, curious, over-achievers, who move swiftly to gather and measure user feedback and behavior, which they use to plan, build, and ship interesting and useful products and features. Even more ideally, this team lives within a socially, and environmentally responsible company or organization, with a strong vision and sense of values, who's primary users' success and happiness are directly linked to it's livelihood. And for gawdsakes, has a sense of humor about the whole thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please read a bit more about me, have a look at my work, and my resume to get a sense of what i can bring to the table. Then, please say hello!

          Luckily, I did everything wrong when i was starting out 13 years ago. I dropped out of art school in Colorado, to try to make it working on the internet in New York City. What seemed (even to me) like a slew of dubious decisions at the time, could not have prepared me more perfectly for the way the world has been turning out. Young and hungry, I had motive and opportunity to become skilled and practiced among the best and brightest. In those early years the internet was to young to be truly disruptive yet, so i had time to learn the core technologies, and found advancement in branding, marketing and advertising, until things hit critical mass, and i finally shifted totally into product design.
        </p>

        <p>
          On my last project, I was the lead designer of a complete re-architecture and redesign of TheLadders core product from the planning stages until it's initial launch. I was lucky to work with an unreasonably talented crew of friends that were focused intensely on quality, speed, and were eager to experiment with a number of new approaches from the design-side including responsive mobile design, an atomic-style organization of components and patterns, SASS style pre-processing with designer-enabled-code collaboration, and design and copy assets in version control.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also started a mailing list for co-workers to exchange cat pictures called lolcats@theladders.com. It was the second largest list at the company.
