        <p>
          It might sound clich√©, but it's not lip-service. I've been very lucky to have spent the last 6 months on a blissful sabbatical. I took the time to clear out my own personal backlog. I travelled to new corners of the world including <a class="roll-link" href="http://resonate.io/"><span data-title="Belgrade">Belgrade</span></a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b9punk/sets/72157633103844836/">Bali</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b9punk/sets/72157633396847820/">Costa Rica</a>.  I practiced painting, drawing and <a href="http://pinterest.com">arts <span class="amp">&amp;</span> crafts</a>, caught up with my reading list, spent time with friends and my family in Colorado, and got into gardening, running, and swimming. It has been wonderful, but when I think of doing this forever I go mad. It's nice for a vacation, but as a lifestyle its honestly got nothing on "working on the future with friends."

        <p>
          And it's getting more interesting as it swallows or disrupts everything from information, politics, biology, to the planet itself. Making Internet has become the truest, and most relevant of the humanities! Designing and building software and network culture is is where all the action is, and right now it badly needs more design thinking to help identify and solve the right problems and broker the relationship between humans and computers. As a thrill-seeking, futurist, designer, I'm more than happy to trade these indulgences in for a front-row seat. That's why I'd rather work on the future with friends than do anything else with my time. <em class="special">Even, like, hookers and blow.</em>

          Deciding <em class="special">what</em> to work on, and <em class="special">who</em> to spend the majority of your waking hours with is a pretty big deal, so I made this site to paint a more complete picture of me than my resume and portfolio can. Here's my pitch (it's picky, I know):
        </p>
        <p>
          I am seeking a senior design-related role on a life-changing, internet software project. With any luck, one of the lives it's been changing (or will) is mine. Ideally this role exists on a small, cross-functional, highly-autonomous team of self-managed, chummy, curious, achievers, who move swiftly to gather and measure user feedback and behavior, which they use to plan, build, and ship interesting and useful products and features. Even more ideally, this team lives within a socially, and environmentally responsible company or organization, with a strong vision and sense of values, who's primary users' success and happiness are directly linked to it's subsistence. And fer gawdsakes, has a sense of humor about the whole thing.

          Please keep scrolling to read a bit more <a href="#about">about me</a>, have a look at <a href="#work">my work</a>, and <a href="#resume">my resume</a> to get a sense of what i can bring to the table. Then, please <a href="#contact">say hello</a>!

              In the words of Peter Drucker "It takes far more energy to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than it takes to improve from first-rate performance to excellence." But it's the amount of the improvement that intrigued me. <em>For example, in a study of students that completed a speed-reading course, initially slow readers where able to improve their reading speed by 67%, but the already strong readers improved their reading speed by 729%.</em> This means that if you're interested in greatness, you need to focus on strengths. The folks at Gallup have spoken to millions of people about strengths over the last half-century and have compiled a <a href="http://pinterest.com/gallup/gallup-strengths-center/">lexicon of "talents"</a> and a <a href="http://www.freestrengthsfinder.com/1-free-strengthsfinder-test.html">tool</a> to help you identify yours. <a href="http://pinterest.com/palebluejen/my-strengths/">These are mine</a>:

        <p class="subhead">Luckily, I did everything wrong.</p>
        <p>
          Thirteen years ago, I dropped out of art school in Colorado, to try to make a living working on the internet in New York City. What seemed (even to me) like a slew of dubious decisions at the time, could not have prepared me more perfectly for the way the world has been turning out. Young and hungry, I had motive and opportunity to become skilled and practiced among the best and brightest.
        </p>

        <p>
          In those early years nothing on the internet really worked yet. The browsers were fighting, the specs were bad, connection speeds were slow, platforms differences were numerous and treacherous, and no one really knew what the internet was good at, other than it was supposed to change the world. So I became experienced at designing flashy moving-target projects in war-time conditions. Because most of the money in those strange days after the first bust and before the next boom came from advertisers, I worked first in a boutique studio, and later as a contractor for big-time ad agencies. Shortly after the critical mass hit <em>(in my estimation somewhere around 2007 at the "early majority" stage of Facebook)</em> I shifted away from client work, and gratefully transitioned to web ui/product design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the course of my first in-house design position&mdash;in a busy, recently-aquired, media company&mdash;I took on the complete redesign of a legacy social network, a Huffington-  post-style blog network, and designed and launched 50+ wordpress radio station websites, while managing both product and creative marketing design teams. It was an amazing and dizzying learning experience that I'm in no hurry to repeat.
        </p>

        <p> 
          In between all these jobs and gigs, I couldn't keep away, so worked on a number of significant side projects. It started with years of design for hacker conferences and events like HOPE (Hackers on Planet Earth), where subject the 8ft paintings I made to place in front windows of the Hotel Pennsylvannia were too incendiary for the masses emerging from Penn Station, and they urged the hotel to remove them. In 2012 I participated in the StartupBus adventure, where handpicked folks pitch ideas and form teams to build a startup in 3 days on a bus-ride to SXSW. My team built a responsive site called <a href="http://happstr.com/prototype"> Happstr </a> to tag where you feel happy and why. We were finalists, and were covered by <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/03/10/happstr/">Mashable</a>, and <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/03/happiness-bus-sxsw/49676/">The Atlantic</a>.

        <p>
          Skipping ahead a few years to today, the internet, and those who make it, have matured greatly. The browsers, platforms, and connection speeds are all still broken, and have multiplied! All those years turned out to be good practice for my latest (and greatest) project, where I was the lead designer of a complete re-thinking of TheLadders core product. Since I was involved from from the planning stages, and since I was lucky to work with an unreasonably talented crew of friends that were willing and eager to experiment, I convinced the team to try a number of new approaches including responsive design, an atomic-style organization of components and patterns, SASS stylesheet pre-processing, and collaborating on design and copy assets in version control. I spoke about many of these ideas at the <a href="http://agileuxnyc.com/">AgileUX</a> conference in 2012 and with several of my teammates from TheLadders started and open-source project for the atomic-design approach. Along the way there were some <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/video/8160491-those-cute-animal-pictures-could-change-your-life/">lulz and cats</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If Ray Kurzweil is right, and we are going to live forever, (and i keep up my lucky-streak), I hope for future versions of this story to include projects involving data visualization, more math and science, more crazy side project adventures, and ...
